## Task: separate dogs from cats

I've processed images, trained a CNN using InceptionV3 as transfer learning and achieved **99.55% test accuracy**. This Google model is really really good.

Here're some of the predictions the ConvNet is making:

Here's the confusion matrix on the test set:

## Evaluation

TODO grad-CAM on test images to see what the CNN is *looking for* in an image
